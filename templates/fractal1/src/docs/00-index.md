## About This Design System

We use [Fractal](https://fractal.build/guide) to compile, serve and generate our styleguide - this makes local development of CSS and HTML very quick. The local development styleguide server (`npm run start`) runs on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and serves static assets out of `src/assets/`. It has CSS, images, and webfonts. Whenever a SCSS file is edited all the files that depend on it will be regenerated and re-copied into that directory.
